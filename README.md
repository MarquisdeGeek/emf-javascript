EMF - Emulator framework in Javascript

## About

This library code is to aid the development of emulators, written in Javascript, by providing basic utility code to simulate ROM and ROM chips, handle CPU control, as so on.

## Note

This code does not do anything interesting, and probably will not make much sense if viewed on its own! Instead, take a peek at the Elliott 903 simulator to see it in action.
